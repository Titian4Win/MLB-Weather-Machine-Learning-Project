# MLB Weather Machine Learning Project
 I used ML to study weather's effect on MLB performance. Data from the 2016 season was analyzed with gradient boosting, XGBoost, and random forest. High winds were shown to negatively impact play and increase runs. Findings could aid players, fans, and coaches in understanding weather's effect on MLB outcomes.
